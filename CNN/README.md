To run this part:

you should download Stanford Dogs dataset by yourself, and make sure you put folders ‘Annotation’ and ‘Images’ into the correct path and install all of the python package we used. Then run CNN.py.

We have set up the following Boolean values: ‘make_dataset’, ‘train’, ‘load’, ‘test’ in the code. The functions of them are: cropping the images to find the dogs’ location, training the model, loading the trained model, testing the model. You can customize them as you wish.

Feel free to use our trained model to test!
