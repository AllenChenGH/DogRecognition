To run this part:

1. create three new empty folder: _data, _pickle, _temp in the same directory with code files.
2. copy data (Images folder in Stanford Dogs Dataset) into _data file.
3. run data_processing.py.
4. run feature_analysis.ipynb.
5. run bag_of_visual_words.ipynb.
6. classification.ipynb.
7. to see more results with different clusters, change N_CLUSTERS in classification.ipynb and run it again.

The results will be provided in classification.ipynb.

PS: you may need to change the version of opencv to run the feature_analysis.ipynb. My Python version is 3.7 and I use opencv 3.4.2.16 on my local environment.
